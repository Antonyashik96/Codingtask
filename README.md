# Task- 1
Create folders in the given folder path on remote host recursively

# Task- 2
Check existance of folder

# Class Node - Task-1
When creating folder structures for different projects the number of folders subfolders and the hierarchy of subfolders may vary. In order to handle this
dynamically depending upon the requirement the concept of **nodes** implemented in **class Node** in **Plus4Data.py**

The tree architecture implemented in this code for Task-1 to create folders and subfolders recursively is shown below.
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="./folder_tree.png" alt="Alt text" width="550"/>
</div>
The same **class Node** can be used for any type of folder tree creation.


**Steps to execute**\
1. `git clone repo`
2. `Pip install requirements.txt`
3. python 3 main.py
